Hello! I am Javier and this is my blog. I am PhD researcher in Artificial Intelligence applied to Biomedical Engineering in [ARTORG](https://www.artorg.unibe.ch/index_eng.html). I love learning, and I will use this blog as a way for me to explain what I am learning at the moment. Some of my interests are:
* Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, mainly their applications to images
* Science! I have a graduate in physics and I am attracted by all kinds of scientific things, so don't be surprised if I pivot from physics to neuroscience to genetics in my posts
