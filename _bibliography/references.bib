abstract = {If a wormhole smoothly connects two different spacetimes, then the flux cannot be separately conserved in any of these spaces individually. Then objects propagating in the vicinity of a wormhole in one space must feel the influence of objects propagating in the other space. We show this in the cases of the scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational field. The case of gravity is perhaps the most interesting. Namely, by studying the orbits of stars around the black hole at the center of our galaxy, we could soon tell if this black hole harbors a traversable wormhole. In particular, with a near future acceleration precision of 10-6 m/s2, a few solar masses star orbiting around Sgr A∗ on the other side of the wormhole at the distance of a few gravitational radii would leave a detectable imprint on the orbit of the S2 star on our side. Alternatively, one can expect the same effect in black hole binary systems, or a black hole-star binary systems.},

abstract = {For a general class of scalar-tensor theories of gravitation the properties of exact static spherically-symmetric vacuum and electrovac solution are discussed. On the other hand, post-Newtonian perfect fluid metric for this class of theories is found and compared with the exact vacuum solution. This comparison shows that the post-Newtonian approximation employs a special value of the scalar charge-mass ratio. This limitation is removed if a term involving scalar charge density is introduced explicitly into the initial Lagrangian. Observational consequences are discussed.},

@article{Ellis1973,
abstract = {The Schwarzchild manifold of general relativity theory is unsatisfactory as a particle model because the singularity at the origin makes it geodesically incomplete. A coupling of the geometry of space-time to a scalar field $\phi$ produces in its stead a static, spherically symmetric, geodesically complete, horizonless space-time manifold with a topological hole, termed a drainhole, in its center. The coupling is R$\mu$v=2$\phi$,$\mu$$\phi$ ,v; its polarity is reversed from the usual to allow both the negative curvatures found in the drainhole and the completeness of the geodesics. The scalar field satisfies the scalar wave equation □$\phi$=0 and has finite total energy whose magnitude, expressed as a length, is comparable to the drainhole radius. On one side of the drainhole the manifold is asymptotic to a Schwarzschild manifold with positive mass parameter m, on the other to a Schwarzschild manifold with negative mass parameter m̄, and -m̄ {\textgreater} m. The two-sided particle thus modeled attracts matter on the one side and, with greater strength, repels it on the other. If m is one proton mass, then -m̄/m≃1 + 10-19 or 1+10-39, according as the drainhole radius is close to 10-33 cm or close to 10-13 cm; the ratios of total scalar field energy to m in these instances are 10 19 and 1039. A radially directed vector field which presents itself is interpreted, for purposes of conceptualization, as the velocity of a flowing "substantial ether" whose nonrigid motions manifest themselves as gravitational phenomena. When the ether is at rest, the two-sided particle has no mass on either side, but the drainhole remains open and is able to trap test particles for any finite length of time, then release them without ever accelerating them; some it can trap for all time without accelerating them. This massless, chargeless, spinless particle can, if disturbed, dematerialize into a scalar-field wave propagating at the wave speed characteristic of the space-time manifold.

@article{Misner1957,
abstract = {If classical physics be regarded as comprising gravitation, source free electromagnetism, unquantized charge, and unquantized mass of concentrations of electromagnetic field energy (geons), then classical physics can be described in terms of curved empty space, and nothing more. No changes are made in existing theory. The electromagnetic field is given by the Maxwell square root of the contracted curvature tensor of Ricci and Einstein. Maxwell's equations then reduce, as shown thirty years ago by Rainich, to a simple statement connecting the Ricci curvature and its rate of change. In contrast to unified field theories, one then secures from the standard theory of Maxwell and Einstein an already unified field theory. This purely geometrical description of electromagnetism is traced out in detail. Charge receives a natural interpretation in terms of source-free electromagnetic fields that (1) are everywhere subject to Maxwell's equations for free space but (2) are trapped in the worm holes of a space with a multiply-connected topology. Electromagnetism in such a space receives a detailed description in terms of the existing beautiful and highly developed mathematics of topology and harmonic vector fields. Elementary particles and real masses are completely excluded from discussion as belonging to the world of quantum physics. {\textcopyright} 1957.},

abstract = {In fine art, especially painting, humans have mastered the skill to create unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay between the content and style of an image. Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. However, in other key areas of visual perception such as object and face recognition near-human performance was recently demonstrated by a class of biologically inspired vision models called Deep Neural Networks. Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.},

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5{\%} and 17.0{\%} which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best entry.},
